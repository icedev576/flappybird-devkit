Flappy Bird - Devkit (source code)
=================

This is a complete devkit for Unity 3D game engine (http://unity3d.com/) for creating Flappy-Bird style games.

You can use the FREE version of the Unity the Professional version is not needed!

It is working with Android, IOS, Windows Phone, and all other Unity target platform. But I only attached an adMob advertizing client, which is for Android only, you can add more.

The application can be purchased via Unity Asset Store (http://u3d.as/content/icedev576/???).

This is a complete working game, but I used NGUI for the menu (start/score buttons), so I can not include it in this project, but there is help to do it with your code.

Written in C#, clean well commented (full) source code is part of the project

For saving the player data I prefer to use this Unity plugin:
