Flappy Bird - Devkit (source code)
=================

This is a complete devkit for Unity 3D game engine for creating Flappy-Bird style games.

It is working with Android, IOS, Windows Phone, and all other Unity target platform. But I only attached an adMob advertizing client, which is for Android only, you can add more.

Unity version needed: 4.3.x, tested on 4.3.4.

The application can be purchased via CodeCanyon (http://codecanyon.net/item/flappybird-devkit/7125494).

This is a complete working game, but I used NGUI for the menu (start/score buttons), so I can not include it in this project, but there is help to do it with your code.

Written in C#, clean well commented (full) source code is part of the project

For saving the player data I prefer to use this Unity plugin:
