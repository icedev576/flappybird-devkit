Flappy Bird - Devkit
=================

This is a complete devkit for Unity 3D game engine for creating Flappy-Bird style games.

The application can be purchased via Unity Asset Store (http://u3d.as/content/icedev576/???).

This is a complete working game, but I used NGUI for the menu (start/score buttons), so I can not include it in this project, but there is help to do it with your code.

For saving the player data I prefer to use this Unity plugin:
